# System requirements

* Linux kernel â‰¥ 3.5 is required (for [seccomp-bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp)).
* rr currently requires an Intel CPU with [Nehalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_%28microarchitecture%29) (2010) or later microarchitecture.
* Running in a VM guest is supported, as long as the VM supports virtualization of hardware performance counters. (VMware and KVM are known to work; Xen works in theory but may be broken.)
